On August 5th 2015, [Waterford Whispers News](http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/) posted a very funny satirical piece about Irish billionaire [Denis O'Brien](http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie/asp/index.asp?ObjectID=636&Mode=0&RecordID=399). His lawyers sent a [Cease and Desist letter](https://twitter.com/ColmWhispers/status/629345366585016321/photo/1) to them and they removed the piece. The contents of the original article are in this GitHub repo. You should fork this repo and publish your own copy. Denis is currently learning the meaning of the phrase ["The Streisand Effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect). #JeSuisWWN
